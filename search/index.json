[{"content":"I want to record the video of my front door 7x24 and notify me when there is someone there. Also I want myself get notified if someone pressed the doorbell even if I\u0026rsquo;m not at home.\nAfter some investigation, I bought a Wyze Video Doorbell Gen 1 (Model number: WVDB1).\nMainly because it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most well supported Thingino video doorbell.\nInstalling Thingino Official wiki already have detailed instruction on how to install Thingino firmware.\nLink:\nhttps://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/wiki/Camera:-Wyze-Doorbell-(V1)\nFrigate 7x24 NVR With current thingino firmware, the video stream is rotated 90 degree. It\u0026rsquo;s not recommended that we rotate it from the device itself given limited resource. Also the model don\u0026rsquo;t have a TF slot, which means we practically need sth like Frigate to do the rotation and recording.\nMy Frigate config looks like below:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 go2rtc: streams: camera1_hd: - ffmpeg:rtsp://thingino:thingino@[ip]:554/ch0#video=h264#rotate=90#audio=copy camera1_sub: - ffmpeg:rtsp://thingino:thingino@[ip]:554/ch1#video=h264#rotate=90#audio=copy - rtsp://thingino:thingino@[ip]:554/ch1 webrtc: candidates: - 127.0.0.1:8555 cameras: camera1: live: streams: Detect View: camera1_sub HD View: camera1_hd enabled: true ffmpeg: inputs: - path: rtsp://localhost:8554/camera1_sub input_args: preset-rtsp-restream roles: - detect - audio - path: rtsp://localhost:8554/camera1_hd input_args: preset-rtsp-restream roles: - record Two way audio Thingino firmware supports 2 way audio (audio input and output). We can make that work with Frigate. Above config I shared contains the key entries to make 2 way audio working.\nKeypart 1: original RTSP as a fallback stream to make audio output working.\n1 2 3 4 camera1_sub: - ffmpeg:rtsp://thingino:thingino@[ip]:554/ch1#video=h264#rotate=90#audio=copy # Two way audio required original rtsp protocol - rtsp://thingino:thingino@[ip]:554/ch1 Keypart 2: WebRTC is required for 2 way audio.\n1 2 3 webrtc: candidates: - 127.0.0.1:8555 Keypart 3: audio tag to make Frigate aware and display relevant UI elements.\n1 2 3 4 5 - path: rtsp://localhost:8554/camera1_sub input_args: preset-rtsp-restream roles: - detect - audio Side note: if you found the output audio is disabed when you use microphone, it\u0026rsquo;s normal, otherwise there will be huge echo.\nRef doc: https://nils.schimmelmann.us/2025-05-18-enabling-open-source-two-way-audio-in-thingino/\nConfigure and customize doorbell button behavior It\u0026rsquo;s a doorbell, so I want the doorbell button to actually work, which means I want it to execute some custom script when it get pressed.\nThe key service here is thingino-button service.\nCheck the status by service thingino-button status.\nIt is configured by /etc/thingino-button.conf\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # User mappings #KEY_0 RELEASE 0 /bin/command1 KEY_1 RELEASE 0 sh /etc/send-msg.sh KEY_1 RELEASE 0 play /usr/share/sounds/doorbell_3.opus #KEY_1 TIMED 0.1 play /usr/share/sounds/doorbell_3.opus #KEY_1 RELEASE 0 doorbell_ctrl 00:11:22:33 15 1 Make sure for all the edit you make to the conf file, you need to restart service service thingino-button restart for it to apply.\nAfter some testing, I found for this model, KEY_1 here is the doorbell button.\nI commented out the original command and replaced doorbell_ctrl command with my own script to trigger home assistant script.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 #!/bin/sh TOKEN=\u0026#34;YOUR HOME ASSISTANT TOKEN\u0026#34; HA_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;YOUR HOME ASSISTANT DOMAIN\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;$(date \u0026#39;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\u0026#39;) - Triggered\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/button.log /bin/curl -X POST \\ -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\u0026#34; \\ -H \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; \\ -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;entity_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;script.send_critical_notification\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; \\ \u0026#34;https://$HA_DOMAIN/api/services/script/send_critical_notification\u0026#34; HomeAssistant Notification For iOS, HomeAssistant app have the capability to send critical alert, which bypass all the mute and silent mode.
